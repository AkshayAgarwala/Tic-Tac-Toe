# Tic-Tac-Toe

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is an exciting two player game. Players take turns marking a box of their choosing with their designated symbol. The first player to achieve their symbol in 3 consecutive boxes (same row, same column, or same diagonal) wins the game. In the event that all the boxes in the board have been marked and neither player wins, the game ends in a tie.
